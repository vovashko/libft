#LIBFT

Is a project from Codam Core (par of 42 network) where I had to build a library in C that could be used in further projects. It also include a part with linked lists function that at that point were optional.
Many of the functions are recreations of already existing ones as a part of standard libraries like <string.h>, <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, however, there are some that are custom based on the task in the curriculum.
